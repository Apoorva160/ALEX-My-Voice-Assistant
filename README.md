## 🚀 How It Works

1. Click on the **"Speak" button**.
2. Say a command like:
   - `"what's the time"`
   - `"play perfect by ed sheeran"`
   - `"tell me a joke"`
3. The assistant replies via speech 
4. Personalized with:  
   > *"Yes, Apoorva"* (You can change this in code if needed!)

## 📱 Mobile Compatibility

- Fully responsive layout and functioning on Android devices (tested on Vivo T3, etc.).
- Speech synthesis may differ in voice tone (male/female) based on OS and browser.

## 📝 Note

- Currently, the assistant does **not** support continuous listening or stop command (`"Alex stop"`). It listens for one command at a time.
- The voice greeting is personalized with "Yes, Apoorva" — you can **change this manually** in the JavaScript if needed for demo or public use.
